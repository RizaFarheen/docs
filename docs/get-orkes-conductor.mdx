# Setting Up Orkes Conductor

You can set up Orkes Conductor using one of the following options:

- **Developer Playground**–Launch a browser-based sandbox for quick prototyping and testing.
- **Local Setup using Docker**–Run a full Conductor stack locally using Docker containers.

## Developer Playground

For quick testing, use the [Orkes Developer Playground](https://developer.orkescloud.com/). This free sandbox environment lets you start building and running workflows instantly—no installation required.


## Orkes Conductor—Local Setup​

Orkes Cloud is the fully managed enterprise version of Orkes Conductor. You can deploy dedicated Conductor clusters on your preferred cloud provider.

For local development and testing, Orkes provides Docker containers via the [orkesio organization on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/orkesio/repositories). These containers include all Orkes Conductor features and **require an Orkes Cloud subscription**.

:::note
The `orkes-conductor-standalone` container is ideal for local development and testing. It includes the full Orkes stack, with a persistent store, server, and system workers. To download it, you'll need an authorization token from the Orkes team.

<TabItem value="mac linux commands" label="macOS, Linux">

**Pre-requisites:**
* Docker must be installed.
* [Orkes Cloud](https://cloud.orkes.io/) subscription.
* Authorization token from Orkes team (Contact support@orkes.io).

**To download and run the container:**
1. Log in to DockerHub using your Orkes access credentials. When prompted for a password, use the access token provided by Orkes.
2. Download and run the latest container build​​:

```bash
export orkes_access_key=<ACCESS_KEY_PROVIDED_BY_ORKES>
echo $orkes_access_key | docker login --username orkesdocker --password-stdin

# Create volumes for persistent stores
docker volume create postgres
docker volume create redis

# Download and start the container
docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:5000 --mount source=redis,target=/redis \
--mount source=postgres,target=/pgdata orkesio/orkes-conductor-standalone:latest
```

**Pre-requisites:**
* [Orkes Cloud](https://cloud.orkes.io/) subscription.
* Authorization token from Orkes team (Contact support@orkes.io).

**Step 1: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows**

The Windows devices must have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed.

**To install WSL:**
1. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting **Run as administrator**.
2. Enter the following command and restart your computer once completed:
```bash
wsl --install
```
If you encounter issues, refer to Microsoft's [WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

**Step 2: Install Docker Desktop for Windows**

Orkes containers are distributed as Docker containers and require a Docker runtime with WSL support. 

**To install Docker Desktop for Windows:**
1. Follow the [instructions on Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) to download and install Docker Desktop. Make sure to download the correct binary for your CPU type.
2. When prompted, select WSL.
3. Restart your computer.

Ensure that the Docker is running automatically after the restart. If not, search for *Docker* in your *Applications* and start it.

**Step 3: Download and run container**
1. Open PowerShell in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting **Run as administrator**.
2. Run the following PowerShell commands individually, or save the commands into a script file (e.g., orkes-enterprise.ps1) and run the script.
```bash
# Set the Orkes access key
$env:orkes_access_key = "<ACCESS KEY PROVIDED BY ORKES>"

# Log in to Docker
$env:orkes_access_key | docker login --username orkesdocker --password-stdin

# Create volumes for persistent stores
docker volume create postgres
docker volume create redis

# Download and start the container
docker run -i -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:5000 --mount source=redis,target=/redis --mount source=postgres,target=/pgdata orkesio/orkes-conductor-standalone:latest
```
Once the container starts, the Orkes Conductor welcome screen appears on the terminal. The UI can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and API docs at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/).
