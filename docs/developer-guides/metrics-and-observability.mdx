# Metrics and Observability

Orkes Conductor allows you to monitor workflow performance using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog. The Conductor dashboard provides a centralized view of key metrics, allowing you to gain real-time insights and set up customizable alerts for proactive monitoring.

## Dashboard setup 

Orkes Conductor uses Prometheus to capture a comprehensive set of metrics, which are readily available in your cluster deployment. On request, these metrics can be pushed to Grafana or Datadog.
:::note Notes
- For cloud deployments, Prometheus and Grafana/Datadog are provisioned by the Orkes team. 
- For on-premise deployments, users must set up their own monitoring tools.
:::

### Accessing the dashboard 

To access the dashboard, go to **Metrics** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster. 

Note: To enable Metrics for your cluster, please get in touch with the [Orkes team](https://orkes.io/talk-to-an-expert).
