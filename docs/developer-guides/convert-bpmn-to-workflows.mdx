# Convert BPMN to Workflows 

In Orkes Conductor, you can quickly convert BPMN files into workflow definitions. This simplifies the migration from BPMN-based systems by supporting standard XML and BPMN formats. Whether you’re transitioning from legacy tools or starting with predefined processes, the BPMN importer enables a fast, code-free transition into the Conductor ecosystem.

## Importing BPMN files

**To import BPMN files:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflows** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select the **⏷** icon next to **+ Define workflow**.
3. From the dropdown menu, select **Import BPMN**.

4. Import files using any of the following methods:
    - **Upload a file**—Select .bpmn file from your local device.
    - **Drag and drop**—Drop the BPMN files directly into the designated area in the UI.
    - **Paste XML**—Paste the raw XML content of your BPMN directly into the **Code** tab.

5. Edit the **Workflow Name** if required.
6. (Optional) Enable **Overwrite workflow** to replace any existing workflow definition with the same name.
7. Select **Import**.

This immediately converts the BPMN files to workflow definitions in Orkes Conductor.

After importing, the newly created workflows appear in **Definitions** > **Workflows**. Each imported file is converted into an equivalent Orkes Conductor workflow, preserving the original logic and structure.

## Next steps

With the imported workflow definitions in place, you can:

- Review and modify the imported workflow as per your requirements.
- [Run the workflow](https://orkes.io/content/how-to-videos/run-workflow) or integrate it into your [existing code](https://orkes.io/content/category/sdks).
- Apply [version control](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/versioning-workflows).
- Enhance it with [advanced Conductor features](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/advanced-workflows).
