# Overview: Workflows


Build workflows in Conductor for a range of uses: event-driven workflows, agentic workflows, process automation, human-in-the-loop processes, microservice orchestration, or real-time API orchestration.


## Ways to create workflows

In Conductor, all workflow definitions are stored as JSON. There are four ways to create a Conductor workflow:
1. **Code**—Using Conductor SDKs, define the workflow in any programming language (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Go, Clojure) and register it to the Conductor server. Once registered, the JSON workflow definition is generated and saved. Learn more in [Write Workflows as Code](write-workflows-using-code).
2. **JSON**—Write the workflow in JSON and register it to the Conductor server using the [`/api/metadata/workflow`](/reference-docs/api/metadata/creating-workflow-definition) endpoint.
3. **Visual workflow editor**—Using Conductor UI, define your workflow visually, which is formatted as JSON under the hood.
4. [**BPMN importer**](/content/developer-guides/convert-bpmn-to-workflows)—Convert existing BPMN files into Conductor workflows using the built-in importer. This provides an easy migration path from BPMN-based systems.


### Static vs dynamic workflows

With Conductor, you can create workflows statically (ahead of time) or dynamically (at runtime). 

Dynamic workflows are created using the workflow-as-code approach, allowing you to write your workflow and task workers in your preferred language and execute them immediately. This is useful in cases where workflows cannot be defined ahead of time, as the number of tasks and flow control depend on real-time factors. Learn more in [Write Workflows as Code](write-workflows-using-code).


### AI-powered and agentic workflows

An agentic workflow is an AI-driven process where the sequence of tasks are dynamically executed with minimal human interaction to achieve a particular goal. Using Conductor’s suite of [AI Orchestration](ai-orchestration.mdx) and [human-in-the-loop](orchestrating-human-tasks) features, you can rapidly build agentic or AI-powered workflows that are auditable, scalable, and safely embedded with human oversight. Learn more in [Advanced Workflows](advanced-workflows). 


### Event-driven workflows

Create event-driven workflows and seamlessly integrate with event-driven pipelines with Conductor’s suite of features: webhooks, event handlers, message broker integrations, and more. Learn more in [Advanced Workflows](advanced-workflows). 


## Workflow definition

A workflow definition contains configuration parameters that define the workflow behavior, including the flow of tasks, workflow inputs and outputs, schema, failure handling settings, and rate-limiting features. The most important parameter is the `tasks` array, which specifies the order and execution of the defined tasks and operators.

Here are the workflow configuration parameters:

| Parameter                     | Description                                                                     | Required/ Optional              |
