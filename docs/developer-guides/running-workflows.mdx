# Running Workflows

There are many ways to run a Conductor workflow:
* Run in Conductor UI
* Set a schedule
* Run from a webhook
* Run from an event
* Run via Conductor APIs (sending signals)
* Run via Conductor SDKs (workflow as code)

The Conductor UI is typically used to run workflows during development and testing. In production, workflows can be triggered from a cron schedule, a webhook event, an event from message brokers like Kafka, or using our APIs/SDKs. The API suite contains various endpoints for starting, pausing, terminating workflows, and more. The SDK approach to running workflows is suitable for dynamic workflows.
