# Running Workflows

You can run a Conductor workflow in several ways:

* From the Conductor UI
* Using a schedule
* From a webhook
* From an event
* Using Conductor APIs (sending signals)
* Using Conductor SDKs (workflow as code)

The Conductor UI is typically used to run workflows during development and testing. In production, workflows can be triggered from a cron schedule, a webhook event, an event from message brokers like Kafka, or using our APIs/SDKs. The API suite contains various endpoints for starting, pausing, terminating workflows, and more. The SDK approach to running workflows is suitable for dynamic workflows.
