# Getting Started with Orkes Template Explorer

Orkes Template Explorer offers a versatile collection of pre-designed workflows as templates. These templates are ready for immediate use and can be customized to meet specific enterprise needs.

In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to get started with Orkes Templates.

## Importing Workflow From Templates

To import workflows from the templates:

1. Go to **Template Explorer** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Browse the templates, choose the one that fits your use case, and select **Import**.

A pop-up will display the selected template's task and workflow names. 

3. To avoid duplication, append the workflow and task names.

5. Refer to the corresponding [template documentation](/content/category/templates) for the configuration updates required.
6. Go to the **Run** tab, provide the input parameters, and select **Run Workflow** to execute the workflow.

With these simple steps, you can generate and execute the workflow in a few minutes, saving you hours.


:::note
Some templates may require setting up workers. These workers are included in the [Orkes Template](https://github.com/orkes-io/orkes-templates) repository and can be updated with your credentials. Refer to the corresponding documentation for detailed instructions.
