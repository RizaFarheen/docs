# Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

All Conductor workflows are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a set of vertices where the connections are unidirectional without any repetition. DAG workflows can only "move forward" and cannot redo a step (or series of steps).

Here is a breakdown of what DAG means:

* **Graph**

For DAGs, a graph refers to "a collection of vertices (or points) and edges (or lines) that indicate connections between the vertices."

Imagine each vertex in the above graph as a microservice. The lines represent a dependency relation between each microservice. However, this graph is not a directed graph, as there is no direction given to each dependency.

* **Directed**

A directed graph means that there is a direction to each connection. For example, this graph is directed:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/directed_graph.png" alt="directed graph" width="50%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 40, paddingTop: 40}} /></p>

Each line has a direction. In the example above, Point N can proceed directly to B, but B cannot proceed directly to N.

* **Acyclic**

Acyclic means without circular or cyclic paths. The example shown above contains directed cyclic graphs, such as A -> B -> D -> A. In contrast, a directed acyclic graph can only begin at one point and end at a different point (A -> B -> D).


## Workflows as DAGs

Since a Conductor workflow is a series of tasks that can connect in only a specific direction and cannot loop, it is a directed acyclic graph:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/sample-workflow-dag.png" alt="Conductor Dag" width="50%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 10, paddingTop: 10}} /></p>

The flow of tasks is specified in a `tasks` array in a JSON file called a workflow definition, which can also be written in code (Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Go, Clojure).


### Can a workflow contain loops and still be a DAG?

Yes. Take the following Conductor workflow, which contains Do-While loops, for example:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/do-while-workflow-dag.jpg" alt="Conductor Dag" width="70%" height="auto" style={{paddingBottom: 10, paddingTop: 10}} /></p>

This workflow is still a DAG because the loop is just a simplified representation for running multiple instances of the same tasks repeatedly. For example, if the 2nd loop in the above workflow is run three times, the workflow path will be:
1. zero_offset_fix_1
2. post_to_orbit_ref_1
3. zero_offset_fix_2
4. post_to_orbit_ref_2
5. zero_offset_fix_3
6. post_to_orbit_ref_3

The path is directed forward to different task instances, each with its own unique inputs and outputs. The Do-While loop simply makes it easier to represent this path.
