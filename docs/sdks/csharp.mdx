# C# SDK

Orkes Conductor C# SDK is maintained here: https://github.com/conductor-sdk/conductor-csharp

## Set up Conductor C# Package

```shell
dotnet add package conductor-csharp
```

## Initialization

Everything related to server settings should be done within the `Configuration` class by setting the required parameter (when initializing an object) like this:

```java
using Conductor.Api;
using Conductor.Client;
using Conductor.Client.Authentication;

var configuration = new Configuration() {
    BasePath = "https://SERVER_URL/api" , // e.g., "https://developer.orkescloud.com/api" for Developer Playground
    AuthenticationSettings = null
};

var workflowClient = configuration.GetClient<WorkflowResourceApi>();
```

### Authentication Settings (optional)

See [Security via Applications](/content/access-control-and-security/applications#generating-access-keys) or this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1b5vZRKn2Q) for details on how to get an access key and secret.

Once we have a key and secret, we can configure the app from properties or environment variables, as shown in this example:

```java
using Conductor.Api;
using Conductor.Client;
using Conductor.Client.Authentication;

var configuration = new Configuration() {
    BasePath = "https://SERVER_URL/api" , // e.g., "https://developer.orkescloud.com/api" for Developer Playground
    AuthenticationSettings = new OrkesAuthenticationSettings("keyId", "keySecret")
};

var workflowClient = configuration.GetClient<WorkflowResourceApi>();

```

Remember to protect your app secrets like any other secrets or passwords.
