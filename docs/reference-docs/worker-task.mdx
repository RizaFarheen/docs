# Worker Task (Simple)

A Worker task (also known as a Simple task) is used to run custom logic implemented in any language. The custom logic can be deployed anywhere and the Worker task requires an external worker for polling.

:::info Prerequisites
Before adding a Worker task to a workflow, you should complete the following:

- Create a worker to run a custom task.
- Define the task in Conductor using Conductor UI or [API](/reference-docs/api/metadata/creating-task-definitions).

For a full guide on how to use workers, refer to [Writing Workers](/developer-guides/using-workers).

## Task parameters

To configure the Worker task, set its `inputParameters` as needed for your worker code. The values can be [passed as a dynamic input](/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor).

The following are generic configuration parameters that can be applied to the task and are not specific to the Worker task. 

<details>
<summary>Caching parameters</summary>

You can cache the task outputs using the following parameters. Refer to [Caching Task Outputs](/faqs/task-cache-output) for a full guide.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| cacheConfig.**ttlInSecond** | The time to live in seconds, which is the duration for the output to be cached. | Required if using *cacheConfig*. |
| cacheConfig.**key** | The cache key is a unique identifier for the cached output and must be constructed exclusively from the task’s input parameters.<br/>It can be a string concatenation that contains the task’s input keys, such as `${uri}-${method}` or `re_${uri}_${method}`. | Required if using *cacheConfig*. |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Schema parameters</summary>

You can enforce input/output validation for the task using the following parameters. Refer to [Schema Validation](/developer-guides/schema-validation) for a full guide.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| taskDefinition.**enforceSchema** | Whether to enforce schema validation for task inputs/outputs. Set to *true* to enable validation. | Optional. | 
| taskDefinition.**inputSchema** | The name and type of the input schema to be associated with the task. | Required if *enforceSchema* is set to true. | 
| taskDefinition.**outputSchema** | The name and type of the output schema to be associated with the task. | Required if *enforceSchema* is set to true.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other generic parameters</summary> 

Here are other parameters for configuring the task behavior.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| optional | Whether the task is optional. The default is false. <br/> <br/> If set to true, the workflow continues to the next task even if this task is in progress or fails.| Optional. | 

</details>

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for a Worker task.

```json
{
  "name": "task_name",
  "taskReferenceName": "task_name_ref",
  "inputParameters": {},
  "type": "SIMPLE"
}
```

## Task output

The Worker task will return the output defined in your worker code.

## Adding a Worker task in UI

**To add a Worker task:**

1. In your workflow, select the **(+)** icon to add a new task. There are two ways to add a worker task:
   - Search for your task using its task name (created previously) and select to add it to the workflow.
   - Add a **Worker Task (Simple)** and enter the task name in Task Definition. This creates a new task definition.
2. Configure the task, such as its inputs, caching, schema validation, and optionality.

Sample worker code snippets are available in the UI for reference.
