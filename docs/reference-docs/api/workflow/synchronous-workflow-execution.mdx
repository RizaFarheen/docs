# Execute Workflow Synchronously

:::info Available since
v5.1.0 and later
:::

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/workflow/execute/{name}/{version}`

Starts a workflow execution synchronously, and returns a response after a specified `waitForSeconds` has passed or when a specified `waitUntilTaskRef` task completes, whichever completes first. 

Set **consistency** to *SYNCHRONOUS* for the fastest in-memory start, *DURABLE* for a persisted start, or *REGION_DURABLE* to copy the start request to another region for extra resilience. If the workflow includes a [Yield task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/yield), the endpoint returns the response based on the `returnStrategy`. 

## Path parameters

| Parameter | Description                             | Type   | Required/ Optional |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| name      | The name of the workflow to be executed. | string | Required.          |
| version | The workflow version. If unspecified, the latest version will be used. | integer | Required. | 

## Query parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                            | Type    | Required/ Optional |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| requestId | A user-generated request ID, which can be used to track the API request. | string | Optional. | 
| waitUntilTaskRef | The reference name of the task to wait for before returning a response. If the workflow is incomplete, the response will return 206. | string | Optional. | 
| waitForSeconds | The duration in seconds to wait before returning a response. Default is 10. | integer | Optional. | 
| consistency | Specifies how the request persists and is replicated.  Supported values: <ul><li>**SYNCHRONOUS**—Executes the workflow directly from memory without persisting the request. This option offers the lowest latency but is non-durable.</li><li>**DURABLE**—The request is stored in persistence before the workflow execution. This ensures reliable execution.</li><li>**REGION_DURABLE**—The request is replicated across regions before the workflow execution. This method provides the highest level of durability and fault tolerance but may introduce additional latency.</li></ul> Default is DURABLE. | string | Optional. |
| returnStrategy | If the workflow includes a [Yield task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/yield), this parameter defines the strategy for when the API returns a response. Supported values: <ul><li>**TARGET_WORKFLOW**–Returns the state of the originally triggered workflow.</li><li>**BLOCKING_WORKFLOW**–Returns the state of the workflow that is currently blocking the execution, which may be a sub-workflow.</li><li>**BLOCKING_TASK**–Returns the execution status of the task that is currently blocking workflow execution.</li><li>**BLOCKING_TASK_INPUT**–Returns the input of the task that is currently blocking workflow execution. Useful for introspecting runtime behavior or debugging.</li></ul> Default is TARGET_WORKFLOW. | string | Optional. | 

## Request body

Contains the workflow inputs. Format the request body as an object containing key-value pairs.

**Example**

```json
{
  "someKey": “someValue”,
  "anotherKey": {}
}
```

## Response

By default, the API returns the workflow’s current state upon synchronous execution. If a Yield task is present, the response is governed by the specified `returnStrategy`.
