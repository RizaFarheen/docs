# Delete Human Task

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/human/tasks/delete/{taskId}`

Deletes a Human task execution. Use this endpoint only to delete a task that has been disconnected from a workflow execution due to error conditions. Under normal conditions, there is no need to use this endpoint.

The invoking user should be one of the following:

- Cluster admin
- Task owner of the Human task
- User with DELETE permission for the Human task definition

:::warning
If this API is used for a Human task that is still associated with a workflow execution, the workflow will not be able to proceed normally and must be retried or restarted to generate a new Human task.
