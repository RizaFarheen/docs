# Signal Running Task Asynchronously

:::info Available since
v5.1.0 and later
:::

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/tasks/{workflowId}/{status}/signal`

Updates the task status and output of a running [Yield task](/content/reference-docs/operators/yield) asynchronously. This operation signals a running Yield task and does not wait for the workflow to proceed or return a response. It immediately acknowledges the signal, making it well-suited for high-throughput systems and fire-and-forget scenarios.

## Path parameters

| Parameter | Description                                 | Type   | Required/ Optional |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| workflowId | The execution ID of the workflow containing the Yield task. | string | Required. | 
| status | The status to which the task is to be updated. Supported values:<ul><li>**IN_PROGRESS**</li><li>**FAILED**</li><li>**FAILED_WITH_TERMINAL_ERROR**</li><li>**COMPLETED**</li></ul> | string | Required. | 

## Request body

Format the request to include any additional parameters, such as task output data. This data is merged with the existing task output.

**Example**

```json
{
    "message": "Data processing completed successfully",
    "recordCount": 1540,
    "status": "SUCCESS"
  }
```

## Response

Returns 200 OK, indicating that the task has been signaled successfully. The response only acknowledges the signal and does not reflect task or workflow progression.
