# Signal Running Task Synchronously

:::info Available since
v5.1.0 and later
:::


**Endpoint**: `POST /api/tasks/{workflowId}/{status}/signal/sync`

Signals a running [Yield task](/content/reference-docs/operators/yield) in the specified workflow synchronously with a new status and output. The request blocks execution until the signal is processed and returns the updated workflow state, based on the `returnStrategy`. This API is useful for tightly coordinated task control or integrating external events into an ongoing workflow. 

## Path parameters

| Parameter | Description                                 | Type   | Required/ Optional |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| workflowId | The execution ID of the workflow containing the Yield task. | string | Required. | 
| status | The status to which the task is to be updated. Supported values:<ul><li>**IN_PROGRESS**</li><li>**FAILED**</li><li>**FAILED_WITH_TERMINAL_ERROR**</li><li>**COMPLETED**</li></ul> | string | Required. | 

## Query parameters

| Parameter | Description                                 | Type   | Required/ Optional |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| returnStrategy | The strategy that determines what response the API returns. Supported values:<ul><li>**TARGET_WORKFLOW**–Returns the full execution state of the originally triggered workflow. Use this when monitoring the overall workflow status or managing orchestration at the top level.</li><li>**BLOCKING_WORKFLOW**–Returns the state of the workflow that is currently blocking the original workflow execution. This may be a sub workflow. Use when signaling Yield tasks in nested workflows.</li><li>**BLOCKING_TASK**–Returns the execution status of the task that is currently blocking workflow execution. Best for real-time status checks.</li><li>**BLOCKING_TASK_INPUT**–Returns the input payload of the task that is currently blocking workflow execution. Ideal for debugging or runtime inspection.</li></ul> The default is TARGET_WORKFLOW. | string | Optional. |

## Request body

Format the request to include any additional parameters, such as task output.

**Example**

```json
{
  "additionalProp1": {},
  "additionalProp2": {},
  "additionalProp3": {}
}
```

## Response

Returns 200 OK, indicating that the task status was successfully updated and the signal was processed. The response payload structure depends on the `returnStrategy` specified in the request.
