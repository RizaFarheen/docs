# Dynamic

The Dynamic task is used to execute a registered task dynamically at run-time. It is similar to a function pointer in programming, and can be used for when the decision to execute which task will only be made after the workflow has begun.

The Dynamic task accepts as input the name of a task, which can be a system task or a custom task registered on Conductor.

## Task parameters

Configure these parameters for the Dynamic task.

| Parameter                          | Description                                                                                                                                                             | Required/ Optional |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| dynamicTaskNameParam               | The input parameter key whose value is used to schedule the task. For example, "taskToExecute", which will then be specified as an input parameter in the Dynamic task. | Required.          |
| inputParameters. **taskToExecute** | The name of the task that will be executed. It can be [passed as a dynamic input](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor).            | Required.          |

### Configuration for calling a sub-workflow

If the Dynamic task to be called is a [Sub Workflow](./sub-workflow) task, then `taskToExecute` must be set to `SUB_WORKFLOW`. The `inputParameters` for the Dynamic task should also include these fields:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JSON" label="Using workflow JSON">

```json
// Dynamic task defintion

"inputParameters": {
  "subWorkflowDefinition":{ //subworkflow JSON definition}
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="name and version" label="Using workflow name and version">

```json
// Dynamic task defintion

"inputParameters": {
  "subWorkflowName":"someName",
  "subworkflowVersion": "1"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for a Dynamic task.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="all" label="All tasks">

```json
{
  "name": "dynamic",
  "taskReferenceName": "dynamic_ref",
  "inputParameters": {
    "taskToExecute": "${workflow.input.dynamicTaskName}" // name of the task to execute
  },
  "type": "DYNAMIC",
  "dynamicTaskNameParam": "taskToExecute" // input parameter key that will hold the task name to execute
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="sub-workflows" label="Sub-workflows">

```json
{
  "name": "dynamic",
  "taskReferenceName": "dynamic_ref",
  "inputParameters": {
    "taskToExecute": "SUB_WORKFLOW",
    "subWorkflowName": "${workflow.input.someName}", // the name of the sub-workflow to execute
    "subWorkflowVersion": "1"
  },
  "type": "DYNAMIC",
  "dynamicTaskNameParam": "taskToExecute"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Task output

During execution, the Dynamic task is replaced with whatever task that is called at runtime. The output of the Dynamic task will be whatever the output of the called task is.

## Adding a Dynamic task in UI

**To add a Dynamic task:**

1. In your workflow, select the **(+)** icon and add a **Dynamic** task.
2. In **Task input params**, configure the task to execute by setting a value in the `taskToExecute` parameter.
   The value can be [passed as a dynamic input](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor) (for example, `${workflow.input.dynamicTaskName}`).

## Examples

Here are some examples for using the Dynamic task.

<details>
<summary>Using the Dynamic task in a workflow</summary>

In this example workflow, shipments are made with different couriers depending on the shipping address. The decision can only be made during run-time when the address is received, and the subsequent shipping task could be either `ship_via_fedex` and `ship_via_ups`. A Dynamic task can be used in this workflow so that the shipping task can be decided in realtime.

```json
// workflow definition

{
  "name": "Shipping_Flow",
  "description": "Ships smartly based on the shipping address",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "shipping_info",
      "taskReferenceName": "shipping_info_ref",
      "inputParameters": {},
      "type": "SIMPLE"
    },
    {
      "name": "shipping_task",
      "taskReferenceName": "shipping_task_ref",
      "inputParameters": {
        "taskToExecute": "${shipping_info.output.shipping_service}"
      },
      "type": "DYNAMIC",
      "dynamicTaskNameParam": "taskToExecute"
    }
  ]
}
```

In the workflow, the `shipping_info` task generates an output that is used to determine which task is run in the Dynamic `shipping_task` task. The line `"taskToExecute": "${shipping_info.output.shipping_service}"` reads the `shipping_service` output from `shipping_info`. Here is the visual diagram of the same workflow:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/dynamic-task-example.png" alt="Dynamic Task Example" width="50%" height="auto"></img></p>

During workflow execution, if the `shipping_info` task output is `"shipping_service": "ship_via_fedex"`, the Dynamic `shipping_task` task will be replaced with the `ship_via_fedex` task:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/ship-via-fedex.jpg" alt="Ship Via Fedex" width="50%" height="auto"></img></p>

If the `shipping_info` task output is `"shipping_service": "ship_via_ups"`, the Dynamic `shipping_task` task will be replaced with the `ship_via_ups` task:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/ship-via-ups.jpg" alt="Ship Via UPS" width="50%" height="auto"></img></p>
