# Terminate Workflow

The Terminate Workflow task allows for the termination of other workflows using their workflow (execution) IDs. It allows users to terminate single or multiple workflows with optional parameters for specifying termination reasons and triggering failure workflows.

## Task parameters

Configure these parameters for the Terminate Workflow task.

| Parameter                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Required/ Optional |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| inputParameters. **workflowId**        | An array of one or more workflow (execution) IDs of the workflow executions to be terminated. It can be [passed as a dynamic input](/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor).                                           | Required.          |
| inputParameters. **terminationReason** | The reason for terminating the workflow(s), which will provide the context of the termination. It can be [passed as a dynamic input](/developer-guides/passing-inputs-to-task-in-conductor).                              | Optional.          |
| triggerFailureWorkflow                 | Whether the failure workflow for the terminated workflow will be triggered. Accepted values:<ul><li>`true`—The failure workflow will be triggered.</li><li>`false`—The default option. The failure workflow will not be triggered.</li></ul> | Required.          |

The following are generic configuration parameters that can be applied to the task and are not specific to the Terminate Workflow task.

Here are other parameters for configuring the task behavior.

| Parameter | Description | Required/ Optional | 
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------- | 
| optional | Whether the task is optional. The default is false. <br/> <br/> If set to true, the workflow continues to the next task even if this task is in progress or fails.| Optional. |

## Task configuration

This is the task configuration for a Terminate Workflow task.

```json
{
  "name": "TW",
  "taskReferenceName": "TW_ref",
  "inputParameters": {
    "workflowId": [
      "someWorkflowID",
      "anotherWorkflowID" // Array containing a single or multiple workflow (execution) IDs
    ],
    "terminationReason": ""
  },
  "triggerFailureWorkflow": false,
  "type": "TERMINATE_WORKFLOW"
}
```

## Task output

The Terminate Workflow task will return the following parameters.

| Parameter           | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| terminatedWorkflows | An array of the workflow (execution) IDs corresponding to the terminated workflows. |

## Adding a Terminate Workflow task in UI

**To add a Terminate Workflow task:**

1. In your workflow, select the **(+)** icon and add a **Terminate Workflow** task.
2. Enter the **Workflow IDs** along with the **termination reason**.
3. (Optional) Check **Trigger Failure Workflow** if needed.

## Examples

Here are some examples for using the Terminate Workflow task.

<details>
<summary>Using the Terminate Workflow task in a workflow</summary>
<p>

To demonstrate the Terminate Workflow task, consider the following sample workflow. This example shows how to configure a workflow that terminates another running workflow.

```json
{
  "name": "terminate-workflow-sample-workflow",
  "description": "Sample workflow to demonstrate terminate workflow task",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "TW",
      "taskReferenceName": "TW_ref",
      "inputParameters": {
        "workflowId": ["289cf124-2240-11ef-8b99-ae209b03ac3f"],
        "terminationReason": "The workflow is terminated due to xxxxxxxxxxx."
      },
      "type": "TERMINATE_WORKFLOW"
    }
  ]
}
```

Upon running the workflow, the workflow execution with the specified ID `289cf124-2240-11ef-8b99-ae209b03ac3f` will be terminated.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/terminate-workflow.png" alt="Terminate Workflow - Successful execution" width="90%" height="auto"></img></p>

To verify this, go to **Executions** > **Workflow** and search for the terminated workflow (execution) ID. Select the workflow (execution) ID to view the execution.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/verifying-terminated-workflow.png" alt="Verifying the terminated workflow from executions" width="90%" height="auto"></img></p>

At the top of the execution details, you can view the termination reason that was provided in the Terminate Workflow task.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/terminated-workflow.png" alt="View of the terminated workflow" width="90%" height="auto"></img></p>

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Terminate workflow with Trigger Failure Workflow enabled</summary>
<p>

In this example workflow, a failure workflow has been set up for it.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/workflow-to-be-terminated.png" alt="Workflow to be terminated" width="90%" height="auto"></img></p>

This is the example workflow JSON definition, which includes the failure workflow:

```json
{
  "name": "test-workflow",
  "description": "test",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "simple",
      "taskReferenceName": "simple_ref",
      "inputParameters": {},
      "type": "SIMPLE"
    }
  ],
  "failureWorkflow": "failure"
}
```

Now, let’s run the workflow and obtain its workflow (execution) ID (example: 8c14384c-2400-11ef-ad70-52278f6d0e42)

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/workflow-id-of-workflow-to-be-terminated.png" alt="Getting the workflow (execution) ID of the workflow to be terminated" width="90%" height="auto"></img></p>

In a separate workflow, you can terminate the above running workflow using the Terminate Workflow task.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/terminate-workflow-sample.png" alt="Main workflow with terminate workflow task" width="40%" height="auto"></img></p>

This is the JSON definition for the second workflow:

```json
{
  "name": "terminate-workflow-demo",
  "description": "Sample workflow",
  "version": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "TW",
      "taskReferenceName": "TW_ref",
      "inputParameters": {
        "workflowId": ["8c14384c-2400-11ef-ad70-52278f6d0e42"],
        "terminationReason": "Workflow is terminated.",
        "triggerFailureWorkflow": true
      },
      "type": "TERMINATE_WORKFLOW"
    }
  ]
}
```

The input parameters for the Terminate Workflow task contain the following configuration:

- The above running workflow’s workflow (execution) ID is provided as an input parameter, along with a termination reason.
- The option to trigger failure workflow is enabled.

Now, let’s run this workflow.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/running-terminate-workflow-demo.png" alt="Running terminate workflow demo" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

Upon completion, the workflow with the ID `8c14384c-2400-11ef-ad70-52278f6d0e42` will be terminated. To view the execution of the terminated workflow, go to **Executions** > **Workflow** and search using the workflow (execution) ID.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/terminated-workflow-execution.png" alt="Execution of the terminated workflow" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

At the top of the execution details, you can view the termination reason that was provided in the Terminate Workflow task and see that the failure workflow has been triggered. Select **Triggered failure workflow** to view the failure workflow’s execution.
