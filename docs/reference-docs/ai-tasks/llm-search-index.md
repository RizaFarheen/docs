# LLM Search Index

A system task to search the vector database or repository of vector embeddings of already processed and indexed documents to get the closest match. You can input a query that typically refers to a question, statement, or request made in natural language that is used to search, retrieve, or manipulate data stored in a database.

For example, in a recommendation system, a user might issue a query to find products similar to one they've recently purchased. The query vector would represent the purchased product, and the database would return a list of products with similar vectors, which are likely to be related or recommended to the user.

## Definitions

"taskReferenceName": "llm_search_index_task_ref",
"inputParameters": {
"vectorDB": "pineconedb",
"namespace": "myNewModel",
"index": "test",
"llmProvider": "azure_openai",
"embeddingModel": "text-davinci-003",
"query": "What is an LLM model?"
},
"type": "LLM_SEARCH_INDEX"
}
```

## Input Parameters

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| vectorDB | Choose the required vector database.<br/><br/>**Note**:If you haven’t configured the vector database on your Orkes console, navigate to the Integrations tab and configure your required provider. Refer to this doc on [how to integrate Vector Databases with Orkes console](/content/category/integrations/vector-databases). |
| namespace | Choose from the available namespace configured within the chosen vector database.<br/><br/>Namespaces are separate isolated environments within the database to manage and organize vector data effectively.<br/><br/>**Note**:Namespace field is applicable only for Pinecone integration and is not applicable to Weaviate integration.|
| index | Choose the index in your vector database where indexed text or data was stored.<br/><br/> **Note:**For Weaviate integration, this field refers to the class name, while in Pinecone integration, it denotes the index name itself.|
| llmProvider | Choose the required LLM provider configured.<br/><br/>**Note:**If you haven’t configured your AI / LLM provider on your Orkes console, navigate to the Integrations tab and configure your required provider. Refer to this doc on [how to integrate the LLM providers with Orkes console](/content/category/integrations/ai-llm).|
| model | Choose from the available language model configured for the chosen LLM provider.<br/><br/>For example, If your LLM provider is Azure Open AI & you’ve configured _text-davinci-003_ as the language model, you can choose it under this field. | 
| query | Provide your search query. A query typically refers to a question, statement, or request made in natural language that is used to search, retrieve, or manipulate data stored in a database. | 
| optional | Enabling this option renders the task optional. The workflow continues unaffected by the task's outcome, whether it fails or remains incomplete. | 

## Output Parameters

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| score | Represents a value that quantifies the degree of likeness between a specific item and a query vector, facilitating the ranking and ordering of results. Higher scores denote a stronger resemblance or relevance of a data point to the query vector. |
| docId | Displays the docId from where the text is queried. |
