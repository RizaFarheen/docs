# Using Variable Idempotency Keys in Webhook-Triggered Workflows

This tutorial demonstrates how to build an idempotent workflow using Orkes Conductor that creates a Jira ticket only once for each unique webhook event. By using a workflow input variable as the idempotency key in a webhook-triggered workflow, you can avoid creating duplicate tickets when the same webhook is triggered multiple times.

This approach is ideal for teams connecting alerting systems, bug reporters, or internal tools to Jira, where event retries or duplication are common.

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Generate an API token and configure project permissions in Jira.
2. Save the token as a secret in Orkes Conductor.
3. Create the ticket automation flow.
4. Create a webhook in Orkes Conductor.
5. Test the workflow using cURL

## Ticket automation workflow

You’ll create an automation that:

- Accepts bug reports via a [custom webhook](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/webhook-integration).
- Triggers a Conductor workflow to create a Jira ticket.
- Prevents duplicate ticket creation for the same bug report using idempotency keys.

Here is the ticket automation workflow that you’ll build in this tutorial:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/ticket-automation-workflow.png" alt="Ticket automation workflow in Orkes Conductor" width="50%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Step 1: Generate an API token and configure project permissions in Jira

This tutorial uses Jira to create tickets from event payloads received through a custom webhook. To enable this, you need to:

- Generate an API token.
- Update the Jira project permission.

### Generate an API token

To authenticate the workflow against Jira, generate an API token from your Atlassian account. This token enables API access to Jira.

**To generate an API token:**

1. Log in to the [Atlassian account](https://id.atlassian.com/).
2. Go to  **Security** > **[API tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)**.
3. Select **Create API token**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/api-token-atlassion.png" alt="Creating API token from Atlassian account" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. Enter a name for the token and set an expiration.
5. Select **Create**.
6. Copy and securely store the token.

### Update the Jira project permission

To allow ticket creation, the user must have the appropriate permissions in the Jira project.

**To update the project permission in Jira:**

1. In Jira, select **Projects** from the left navigation.
2. Select the Jira project where bug tickets will be created. For example, you can use the default project, *Demo service project*.
3. In your project, select **Project settings**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/jira-project-settings.png" alt="Accessing project settings in a Jira ticket" width="80%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. In the left navigation menu, go to **Access** > **People and access**.
5. Assign the user with both **Administrators** and **Service Desk Team** roles.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/jira-user-role.png" alt="Updating the user role in a Jira project" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Step 2: Store the token as a secret in Orkes Conductor

After generating the API token, encode it with Base64 and store it securely as a [secret in Orkes Conductor](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/secrets-in-conductor) so it can be used for authentication without being exposed during execution.

Jira uses Basic Authentication, which requires a Base64-encoded string containing your Atlassian email address and the API token.

### Encode the token with Base64

**To create the basic authentication string:**

1. Open a Terminal.
2. Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with your credentials:

```shell
echo -n "your-email@example.com:<your_api_token>" | base64
```

3. Copy the output, which is your Base64-encoded authentication string.

### Store as a secret in Orkes Conductor

**To store the basic authentication token as a secret:**

1. Go to [**Definitions** > **Secret**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/secrets) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Add secret**.
3. Set the **Secret name** as *atlassian-token*.
4. Paste the Base64 encoded string as the **Secret value**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/saving-as-secret.png" alt="Saving Base64 encoded token as a secret in Orkes Conductor" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

5. Select **Add** to save the secret.

## Step 3: Create the ticket automation workflow

Next, define a workflow in Orkes Conductor that creates a Jira ticket when triggered by a webhook. The workflow includes an [HTTP task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/http) that sends an API request to Jira.

### Create workflow

**To create the ticket automation workflow:**

1. Go to [**Definitions** > **Workflows**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/workflowDef) and select **+ Define workflow.**
2. In the **Code** tab, paste the following JSON:

```json
{
 "name": "ticket-automation-workflow",
 "description": "Creates a Jira task for a new bug reported via webhook.",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "create_jira_task",
     "taskReferenceName": "create_jira",
     "inputParameters": {
       "http_request": {
         "uri": "<YOUR-ATLASSIAN-PORTAL-URL>/rest/api/3/issue",
         "method": "POST",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Basic ${workflow.secrets.atlassian-token}",
           "Content-Type": "application/json"
         },
         "body": {
           "fields": {
             "project": {
               "key": "<YOUR-JIRA-PROJECT-KEY>"
             },
             "summary": "${workflow.input.title}",
             "issuetype": {
               "name": "Task"
             },
             "description": {
               "type": "doc",
               "version": 1,
               "content": [
                 {
                   "type": "paragraph",
                   "content": [
                     {
                       "text": "Reported by: ${workflow.input.reported_by}\nBug ID: ${workflow.input.bug_id}",
                       "type": "text"
                     }
                   ]
                 }
               ]
             }
           }
         }
       }
     },
     "type": "HTTP"
   }
 ],
 "inputParameters": [
   "bug_id",
   "title",
   "reported_by"
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

3. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

### Edit workflow

Next, update the placeholders in your workflow definition:

- On line 13, update `<YOUR-ATLASSIAN-PORTAL-URL>` with your Jira portal URL. For example, if your Jira URL is https://your-atlassian.atlassian.net/, the endpoint URL will be https://your-atlassian.atlassian.net.rest/api/3/issue.  
- On line 22, update `<YOUR-JIRA-PROJECT-KEY>` with your Jira project key. If you’re using the default demo project, the key is DEMO. You can find your project key on the Jira project settings page.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/project-key-from-jira.png" alt="Getting the project key from a Jira project" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

Select **Save** to update the workflow. The Conductor UI highlights the changes in real-time, making it easier to review and understand the edits before saving the workflow.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/conductor-ui-showing-workflow-changes.png" alt="Orkes Conductor UI displaying the workflow changes made" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Step 4: Create a webhook in Orkes Conductor

In this example, we use a *Custom* webhook to simulate input from an internal bot. However, you can create a webhook based on your requirements using [any supported platforms](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/webhook-integration#step-2-create-a-webhook) or a Custom webhook for integration with other systems.

Create a webhook that triggers the workflow you defined. Configure it to use the *bug_id* input variable as the idempotency key to prevent duplicate executions for the same event.

**To create a webhook:**

1. Go to [**Definitions** > **Webhook**](https://developer.orkescloud.com/configure-webhooks) from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New webhook**.
3. Configure the following parameters:

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/webhook-for-ticket-automation-flow.png" alt="Webhook in Orkes Conductor triggering a workflow on receiving an event" width="80%" height="auto"></img></p>

    - In **Webhook name**, enter a webhook name such as *CreateJiraTickets*.
    - Select **Source platform** as **Custom**.
    - Set a request **Header** for the webhook.
    - Enable **Start workflow when webhook event comes**.
    - In the **Workflow name**, select *ticket-automation-workflow*.
    - In the **Idompotency key**, enter `${workflow.input.bug_id}`.
    - Set the **Idompotency strategy** as **Return Existing**.

4. Select **Save**.

After saving, Conductor generates an unverified webhook URL. 

[URL verification](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/webhook-integration#step-3-verify-the-webhook-url) depends on the type of webhook. For Custom webhooks, Conductor uses header-based verification. This means incoming requests must include headers that match the exact names and values specified during configuration. If the request doesn’t match all required headers, it will be ignored. The URL is marked as verified when the first valid request with matching headers is received.

By using `${workflow.input.bug_id}` as the idempotency key, Conductor will prevent duplicate workflow executions for the same bug report, even if the webhook is triggered multiple times.

## Step 5: Test the workflow using cURL

Simulate a sample input using a cURL command. You can adapt this to accept inputs from various internal sources, such as email systems, monitoring tools, or internal bots.

**To send a cURL request:**

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with your actual values:

```shell
curl -X POST "<YOUR-CONDUCTOR-WEBHOOK-URL>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "<YOUR-HEADER-NAME>: <YOUR-HEADER-VALUE>" \
  -d '{
    "bug_id": "BUG-2045",
    "title": "Java SDK workflow execution bug",
    "reported_by": "Internal Bot"
  }'
```

This verifies the Webhook URL in Conductor and triggers the *ticket-automation-workflow*. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/webhook-event-received.png" alt="Webhook event received in Orkes Conductor" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

To confirm the workflow execution, navigate to **Executions** > **Workflow** in Orkes Conductor and verify the execution.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/workflow-triggered-idempotency.png" alt="Workflow triggered from a webhook event" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

In your Jira project, go to **Queues** > **All Open** to confirm that the ticket has been created. Then, open the ticket to verify that the description has been passed through the webhook correctly.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/jira-ticket.png" alt="Ticket created in Jira" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

### Test the idempotency behavior

Consider a scenario where the same bug report is submitted multiple times due to a system glitch or network retry. If not handled properly, this could lead to hundreds or thousands of duplicate tickets in large systems.

**To simulate this behavior:**

1. Re-run the same cURL request using the same *bug_id* value as before.

```shell
curl -X POST "<YOUR-CONDUCTOR-WEBHOOK-URL>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "<YOUR-HEADER-NAME>: <YOUR-HEADER-VALUE>" \
  -d '{
    "bug_id": "BUG-2045",
    "title": "Java SDK workflow execution bug",
    "reported_by": "Internal Bot"
  }'
```

2. Check the webhook activity in Conductor. A new event is received, but no new workflow is triggered. You can verify this by comparing timestamps.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/idempotent-behavior.png" alt="Idempotent behavior showing no workflow triggered for the same idempotency key event" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

This confirms that Orkes Conductor correctly recognized the event as a duplicate. Since the webhook was configured with *bug_id* as the idempotency key and the strategy set to **Return Existing**, it avoids initiating a new workflow and instead references the original execution.

If you send a request with a different *bug_id*, Conductor treats it as a new event:

```shell
curl -X POST "<YOUR-CONDUCTOR-WEBHOOK-URL>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "<YOUR-HEADER-NAME>: <YOUR-HEADER-VALUE>" \
  -d '{
    "bug_id": "BUG-3045",
    "title": "Task execution bug",
    "reported_by": "Internal Bot"
  }'
```

This triggers a new webhook event, starts a new workflow instance, and creates a new Jira ticket.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/new-ticket-creation-workflow.png" alt="New ticket creation flow for another idempotency key" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

This approach keeps your system clean, reliable, and free from duplicate ticket noise, even under high-load or retry-heavy conditions.

## Troubleshooting

Here are a few common issues you might encounter while setting up the Jira ticket automation workflow and how to resolve them:

| Issue | Possible causes and fixes | 
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| Webhook doesn’t trigger the workflow | <ul><li>The webhook URL is incorrect or malformed.</li><li>The webhook is not configured to **Start workflow when webhook event comes**.</li><li>Required headers are missing or do not match the expected configuration.</li><li>The workflow name in the webhook settings does not match the actual workflow definition.</li></ul> | 
| Jira ticket isn’t created | <ul><li>Make sure your Jira portal and project key are correctly set in the workflow definition. </li><li>Verify that the secret *atlassian-token* contains a valid Base64-encoded token. </li><li>Confirm that your user has both Administrator and Service Desk Team roles in the Jira project.</li></ul> | 
| Authentication fails with Jira API | <ul><li>Verify the format of the Base64-encoded authentication string `email:api_token`.</li><li>Regenerate your API token from Atlassian if it has expired. </li><li>Make sure the workflow uses the correct secret name (*atlassian-token*).</li><li>Double-check that the email address used in the Base64 string matches the account tied to the API token.</li></ul> | 
| Workflow execution fails | <ul><li>Review the workflow execution logs in **Executions** > **Workflow**.</li><li>Make sure the webhook payload includes all required input parameters: *bug_id*, *title*, and *reported_by*.</li></ul> |
