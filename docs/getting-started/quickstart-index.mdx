# Quickstarts


This quickstart series teaches you the basics of developing applications and systems with Conductor, given a basic understanding of [Conductor’s worker-task queue architecture](/core-concepts#conductor-architecture). By creating your first Conductor workflow, you’ll learn how orchestration lets you develop distributed systems without worrying about coordinating complexity.

In this series, we will cover the following fundamentals:
1. Write a custom worker
2. Create a workflow
3. Debug a workflow

:::tip
Familiarize yourself with the [core concepts](/core-concepts) in Conductor before diving into our quickstarts.
