# HTTP Endpoint Monitoring

:::note
This template is only available on the [Developer Playground](https://developer.orkescloud.com/) in Launch Pad.
:::

This endpoint monitoring template checks the health of a specified HTTP endpoint and sends an email alert if the endpoint is unreachable or returns an unexpected status code.

This template serves as a quickstart for building monitoring workflows. You can use this as a foundation and extend it with features such as alternative notification channels, and more.

## Conductor features used

This template utilizes the following Conductor features:

- [HTTP task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/http)
- [Switch task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/switch)
- [SendGrid task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/sendgrid)
- [Set Variable task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/set-variable)
- [Terminate task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/terminate)

## How to use the template

1. Import the template from Launch Pad.
2. Configure and verify the sender email in SendGrid.
3. Run workflow.

:::info Prerequisites:
This template uses SendGrid integration. Ensure that you obtain the [SendGrid API key](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) from your SendGrid account.
:::

### Step 1: Import the template

The endpoint monitoring template is available only in the [Developer Playground](https://developer.orkescloud.com/) on Launch Pad.

**To import the template:**

1. Log in to [Developer Playground](https://developer.orkescloud.com/).
2. Go to **Launch Pad** on the left navigation menu.
3. Select **HTTP Endpoint Monitoring** > **Use Template**.
4. Select **Import**.
5. In **Required Integrations** > **SendGrid email**, either select an existing SendGrid integration or create a new one.
  - If creating a new one, select **Create integration** from the drop-down.
6. Enter an **Integration name**.
7. In **API Key**, paste the API key copied from the SendGrid account.
8. Select **Save**.
9. Select **Continue Workflow** to import the workflow.

The `HTTP_EndPoint_Monitoring` workflow is now imported and ready for use.

#### Understand the workflow logic

This section explains the workflow logic and how to execute it.

**Workflow inputs:**

- **URL**–The HTTP(S) endpoint to be monitored using the workflow.
- **sender_email**–The sender email address to display the alert.
- **customer_email**–The recipient email address for alert notifications.

**Example input payload:**

```json
{
 "URL": "https://orkes.io/",
 "sender_email": "verified-sender@example.com",
 "customer_email": "alerts@example.com"
}
```

**Workflow logic:**

- The workflow begins with an [HTTP task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/http) that sends a GET request to the specified endpoint.
- Next, the [Switch task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/switch) evaluates the HTTP status code to determine if the response indicates a success or failure.
  - If the response status code is **200**, a [Set Variable task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/set-variable) sets a success flag, and the workflow completes.
  - For any other response or failure (e.g., DNS error), the [Switch task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/switch) sends execution to the **defaultCase** path.
- In the **defaultCase** path, a [SendGrid task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/sendgrid) sends an email notification using the provided sender and recipient addresses. The subject and message content indicate that the endpoint health check failed.
- After sending the alert, a [Terminate task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/operators/terminate) ends the workflow with the reason “**did not receive 200 status code**.”

### Step 2: Configure and verify sender email in SendGrid

For the SendGrid integration to work, the [sender email must be verified](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/sending-email/sender-verification#adding-a-sender).

**To verify the sender email:**

1. Go to [**Marketing** > **Senders**](https://mc.sendgrid.com/senders) from the left menu on your SendGrid account.
2. Select **Create New Sender**.
3. Enter the following mandatory parameters:
  - From Name
  - From Email Address
  - Reply to
  - Company Address
  - City
  - Country
  - Nickname

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/sender-creation.jpg" alt="Adding a sender in SendGrid portal" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. Select **Save**.

This saves the sender to your SendGrid portal and sends a verification email. Once the sender clicks the verification link, the sender’s status is updated to ‘verified’ within the SendGrid portal.

### Step 3: Run the workflow

**To run the workflow:**

1. From the `HTTP_EndPoint_Monitoring` workflow definition, go to the **Run** tab.
2. Enter the **Input Params**. For example:

```json
{
 "URL": "https://orkes.io/", 
 "sender_email": "<YOUR-SENDGRID-VERIFIED-EMAIL>",
 "customer_email": "<ALERT-RECEIVER-EMAIL>" 
}
```

3. Select **Execute**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/http-endpoint-workflow-sample-execution.gif" alt="Sample execution for HTTP endpoint monitoring workflow" width="80%" height="auto"></img></p>

## Workflow output

If the monitored HTTP endpoint is healthy, the workflow follows the success path (**200**) and completes successfully.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/run-workflow-from-ui-http-endpoint-monitoring-template.png" alt="Sample workflow executed successfully" width="80%" height="auto"></img></p>

If the endpoint is down, the workflow follows the **defaultCase**, sends an alert email, and ends with a termination reason.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/endpoint-monitoring-template-default-path-execution.png" alt="Endpoint monitoring template’s default execution path" width="80%" height="auto"></img></p>

The user receives an alert email through SendGrid.

## Workflow modifications

This template provides a starting point for customizing the workflow to your needs.  You can add additional steps, such as:

- Add a different provider (like Opsgenie for incident notifications, Slack/Microsoft Teams notification, or integrate with Jira/Zendesk via API ).
- Modify email content based on your requirements and next steps.
- Add any escalation steps.
