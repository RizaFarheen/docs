# Running a Worker Until Condition is met

## Introduction - Custom Poll Worker

We can use a worker and keep it running until a condition is met. This is similar to the [HTTP Poll](/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/http-poll) task, where
you can poll an HTTP endpoint until a specific condition is met. Having a worker do the same is useful
when you don't have an endpoint to call directly from Conductor.

            taskResult.addOutputData("message", "pollCounter param not found in input, will use default of " + defaultPollCount + " polls");
        }

        int pollCounter = Math.min(10, castToInt(task.getInputData().getOrDefault(POLL_COUNTER, defaultPollCount)));
        int pollIntervalSeconds = Math.min(10, castToInt(task.getInputData().getOrDefault(POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS, 5)));

        // Add these to the output for context
        taskResult.addOutputData(POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS, pollIntervalSeconds + " (this test task has a max limit of 10 seconds)");
        taskResult.addOutputData(POLL_COUNTER, pollCounter + " (this test task has a max limit of 10 iterations)");

        // We can read current iteration from the task output as the data will be retained on the worker when polled
        int currentIteration = castToInt(taskResult.getOutputData().getOrDefault(CURRENT_ITERATION, 0));

        // Increment the current iteration and set to the task output
        taskResult.addOutputData(CURRENT_ITERATION, ++currentIteration);
        taskResult.addOutputData("updatedTime", new Date().toString());

        // While condition is not met, keep task in progress
        if (currentIteration < pollCounter) {
            taskResult.setStatus(TaskResult.Status.IN_PROGRESS);
            // Set to configured seconds to callback, and you can set this to any value as per the requirements
            taskResult.setCallbackAfterSeconds(pollIntervalSeconds);
            return taskResult;
        }

        // Set task as completed now that the poll count condition is met
        taskResult.setStatus(TaskResult.Status.COMPLETED);
        return taskResult;
    }`}

In this example worker, we use the `callbackAfterSeconds` attribute to keep the worker in progress
until a condition is met. This can be any arbitrary condition that our code defines.

Specifically, this example waits for the poll count to reach the input parameter `pollCounter`.

When you return a task as `IN_PROGRESS` with a `callbackAfterSeconds` value set, Conductor
will schedule the same task instance to be polled exactly after the `callbackAfterSeconds` value.

We are leveraging the output data to hold the context across polls, and once it reaches the desired state, we exit `IN_PROGRESS`
and mark the task as `COMPLETED`.

Go ahead and try [this worker](https://developer.orkescloud.com/workflowDef/poll-until-condition-workflow) in a workflow in our Developer Playground environment. We have already configured this in our sandbox, so it should run when you test.

:::tip Language agnostic
Such workers can be implemented in any of the languages.
