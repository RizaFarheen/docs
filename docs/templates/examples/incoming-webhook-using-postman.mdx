# Incoming Custom Webhook using Postman

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a custom webhook in Orkes Conductor and trigger it with a Postman request.

In this tutorial, you will:
1. Create a Conductor workflow with a Wait for Webhook task.
2. Set up a custom webhook in Conductor to receive events.
3. Run the workflow.
4. Send a Postman request to trigger the webhook.
5. Verify incoming webhook requests.

To follow along, ensure you have access to the free [Orkes Developer Playground](https://developer.orkescloud.com/).

## Step 1: Create a workflow in Conductor

Create a workflow with a [Wait for Webhook task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/wait-for-webhook) to receive webhook events.

**To create a workflow:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflows** from the left menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Define workflow**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "name": "sample-webhook-postman",
 "description": "Sample webhook for demonstration purpose",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "webhook_task",
     "taskReferenceName": "webhook_task_ref",
     "inputParameters": {
       "matches": {
         "$['data']['recipientId']": "${workflow.input.recipientId}"
       }
     },
     "type": "WAIT_FOR_WEBHOOK"
   }
 ],
 "inputParameters": [
   "recipientId"
 ],
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Your workflow will look like this:

## Step 2: Create a webhook in Conductor

Next, create a custom webhook that listens for incoming events from Postman.

**To create a webhook:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Webhook** from the left menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New webhook**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "verifier": "HEADER_BASED",
 "headers": {
   "appName": "demoApp"
 },
 "name": "SampleWebhookPostman",
 "receiverWorkflowNamesToVersions": {
   "sample-webhook-postman": 1
 },
 "sourcePlatform": "Custom"
}
```

4. Select **Save**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/sample-webhook.png" alt="Webhook example" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

An unverified webhook URL is generated. It remains unverified until a request with the expected headers is received.

## Step 3: Run workflow

Before triggering the webhook, run the workflow with an input value that the webhook event should match.

Since the Wait for Webhook task uses the following input matches:

```json
       "matches": {
         "$['data']['recipientId']": "${workflow.input.recipientId}"
       }
```
Run the workflow to pass `recipientId` as the workflow input. 

Go back to your workflow definition, navigate to the **Run** tab, and paste the following input parameters:

```json
{
"recipientId":"123"
}
```

Select **Run workflow** to view the execution.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/run-webhook-workflow.png" alt="Workflow execution" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

The workflow is now running and waiting for a webhook event that contains an input payload with `“recipientId”: "123"`.

## Step 4: Send a request using Postman

Now that the workflow is waiting for input, you can send a matching request using Postman.

You ran the workflow using the input:
```json
{
"recipientId":"123"
}
```

Therefore, send a matching request from Postman.

**To configure a Postman request:**

1. Log in to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
2. Select **Send an API request** > **New Request**.
3. Create a new request with the following configurations:
  - **Method**: POST.
  - **URL**: The unverified webhook URL from Conductor.
4.  In the **Headers** section, add the following key-value pair: `appName: demoApp`.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/configuring-headers-in-postman-request.jpg.png" alt="Configuring headers in Postman request" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

5. In the **Body** tab, select **raw** and choose **JSON**. Paste the following payload:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "recipientId": "123"
  }
}
```

:::note
Ensure to pass the matching input JSON. The value for "recipientId" in the request payload must match the input provided when running the workflow ("123" in this example).
:::

6. Select **Send**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/send-request-postman.png" alt="Sending POST request from Postman" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

The Postman request should return a 200 OK.

## Step 5: Verify incoming webhook requests

Once the request is received, the webhook is automatically verified, and the payload is received in Conductor.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/workflow-triggered.png" alt="Workflow with webhook task triggered on receiving webhook event" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

Select the workflow (execution) ID from the **Webhook execution history** to view the execution. You can verify that the webhook task is completed.

You’ve successfully created and triggered a custom webhook in Orkes Conductor using Postman.
