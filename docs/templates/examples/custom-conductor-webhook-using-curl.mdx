# Incoming Custom Conductor Webhook using cURL

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a custom webhook in Orkes Conductor and trigger it with a cURL request.

In this tutorial, you will:
1. Create a Conductor workflow with a Wait for Webhook task.
2. Set up a custom webhook in Conductor to receive events.
3. Run the workflow.
4. Send a cURL request to trigger the webhook.
5. Verify incoming webhook requests.

To follow along, ensure you have access to the free [Orkes Developer Playground](https://developer.orkescloud.com/).

## Step 1: Create a workflow in Conductor

Create a workflow with a [Wait for Webhook task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/wait-for-webhook) to receive webhook events.

**To create a workflow:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Workflows** from the left menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ Define workflow**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "name": "sample-webhook-demo-using-curl",
 "description": "Sample workflow for demonstration",
 "version": 1,
 "tasks": [
   {
     "name": "webhook_task",
     "taskReferenceName": "webhook_task_ref",
     "inputParameters": {
       "matches": {
         "$['event']['type']": "${workflow.input.type}"
       }
     },
     "type": "WAIT_FOR_WEBHOOK"
   }
 ],
 "inputParameters": [],
 "outputParameters": {},
 "schemaVersion": 2
}
```

4. Select **Save** > **Confirm**.

Your workflow will look like this:

## Step 2: Create a webhook in Conductor

Next, create a custom webhook that listens for incoming events from cURL.

**To create a webhook:**

1. Go to **Definitions** > **Webhook** from the left menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New webhook**.
3. In the **Code** tab, paste the following code:

```json
{
 "verifier": "HEADER_BASED",
 "headers": {
   "someKey": "someValue"
 },
 "name": "SampleWebhookforcURL",
 "receiverWorkflowNamesToVersions": {
   "sample-webhook-demo-using-curl": 1
 },
 "sourcePlatform": "Custom"
}
```

4. Select **Save**.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/sample-webhook-using-curl.png" alt="Webhook created in Conductor" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

An unverified webhook URL is generated. It remains unverified until a request with the expected headers is received.

## Step 3: Run workflow

Before triggering the webhook, run the workflow with an input value that the webhook event should match.

Since the Wait for Webhook task uses the following input matches:

```json
"matches": {
     "$['event'][‘type’]": "${workflow.input.type}"
}
```
Run the workflow to pass `type` as the workflow input. 

Go back to your workflow definition, navigate to the **Run** tab, and paste the following input parameters:

```json
{
"type":"type-1"
}
```

Select **Run workflow** to view the execution.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/running-workflow-curl.png" alt="Running the workflow" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

The workflow is now running and waiting for a webhook event that contains an input payload with `“type”: "type-1"`.

## Step 4: Send a request using cURL

Now that the workflow is waiting for input, you can send a matching request using cURL.

You ran the workflow using the input:
```json
{
"type":"type-1"
}
```

Therefore, send a cURL request to match this: 

```curl
curl -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "Accept:application/json" \
     -H 'someKey: someValue'    \
     -X POST '<WEBHOOK-URL-IN-CONDUCTOR>' \
     -d '{"event": {"type" : "type-1"}}'
```

:::note Notes
- Ensure that the request includes the matching headers and webhook URL in Conductor.
- The value for "type" in the request payload must match the input provided when running the workflow ("type-1" in this example).
:::

## Step 5: Verify incoming webhook requests

Once the request is received, the webhook is automatically verified, and the payload is received in Conductor.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/verified-webhook-curl.png" alt="Verified Webhook" width="100%" height="auto" /></p>

Select the workflow ID from the **Webhook execution history** to view the execution. You can verify that the webhook task is completed.

You’ve successfully created and triggered a custom webhook in Orkes Conductor using cURL. This setup enables you to build powerful, event-driven workflows that respond to real-time data from external systems.
