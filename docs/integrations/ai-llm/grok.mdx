# Grok Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use system AI tasks in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary AI/LLM providers. This guide explains how to integrate Grok with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from Grok.
2. Configure a new Grok integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Add models to the integration.
4. Set access limits to the AI model to govern which applications or groups can use it.

## Step 1: Get the Grok credentials

To integrate Grok with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the API key from the Grok console.

**To get the API key:**

1. Sign in to the [Grok console](https://console.x.ai/).
2. Go to **API Keys** and select **Create API Key**.

3. Enter a **Name** and select **Create**.
4. Copy and store the generated key securely, as it is shown only once.

## Step 2: Add an integration for Grok

After obtaining the credentials, add a Grok integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create a Grok integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **AI/LLM** section, choose **Grok**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| API Key | The API key copied previously from the Grok platform.
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Add Grok models

Once you’ve integrated Grok, the next step is to configure specific models.

Grok has different models, such as grok-beta, grok-vision-beta, grok-2-vision-1212, and more, each designed for various use cases. Choose the model that best fits your use case.

**To add a model to the Grok integration:**

1. Go to the **Integrations** and select the **+** button next to the integration created.

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/adding-grok-integration-models.png" alt="Create new model for Grok Integration" width="100%" height="auto"></img></p>

2. Select **+ New model**.
3. Enter the **Model name** and a **Description**. Get the complete [list of Grok models](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models).

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/grok-model.png" alt="Creating new model for Grok Integration" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the model instantly.
5. Select **Save**.

This saves the model for future use in AI tasks within Orkes Conductor.

## Step 4: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which [applications](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications) or [groups](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/users-and-groups#groups) can use the models.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required AI models and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/grok-rbac.png" alt="Add Permissions for Grok Integration" width="70%" height="auto"></img></p>

The group or application can now access the AI model according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using [AI/LLM tasks](https://orkes.io/content/category/reference-docs/ai-tasks).
