# AMQP Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use the [Event task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/event) or [enable Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/enabling-cdc-on-conductor-workflows) in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary message brokers. This guide explains how to integrate AMQP with Orkes Conductor to publish and receive messages from queues. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from AMQP.
2. Configure a new AMQP integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Set access limits to the message broker to govern which applications or groups can use them.

## Step 1: Get the AMQP credentials

To integrate AMQP with Orkes Conductor, set up AMQP according to your requirements and retrieve the following credentials from your AMQP console:

- Username
- Password
- Host
- Port
- Virtual host

## Step 2: Add an integration for AMQP

After obtaining the credentials, add an AMQP integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an AMQP integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Message Broker** section, choose **AMQP**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Paramters | Description                         | 
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | 
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| Protocol | The communication protocol to be used. Supported values:<ul><li>**amqp**</li><li>**amqps** (Recommended for secure connections)</li></ul> |
| Username | The username to authenticate and authorize the connection. | 
| Password | The password associated with the username. |
| Host | The hostname of the server where the message broker is running. |
| Port | The port number on the host where the message broker is running. The default ports are:<ul><li>5671 for amqps</li><li>5672 for amqp</li></ul> |
| Virtual Host | The namespace that allows multiple messaging environments to coexist within a single broker. |
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which applications or groups can use the message broker.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required message broker and toggle the necessary permissions.

The group or application can now access the message broker according to the configured permissions.

## Next steps

With the integration in place, you can now:

- [Create Event Handlers](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/event-handler) for use in [Event tasks](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/event).
- [Enable Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/enabling-cdc-on-conductor-workflows) to send workflow state changes to message brokers.
