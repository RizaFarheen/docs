# Azure Service Bus Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use the [Event task](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/event) or [enable Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/enabling-cdc-on-conductor-workflows) in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the necessary message brokers. This guide explains how to integrate Azure Service Bus with Orkes Conductor to publish and receive messages from queues. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from Azure Service Bus.
2. Configure a new Azure Service Bus integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Set access limits to the message broker to govern which applications or groups can use them.

## Step 1: Get the Azure Service Bus credentials

To integrate Azure Service Bus with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the following credentials from your Azure portal:

- (If the connection is established using the connection string from the Azure portal) [Endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-servicebus?tabs=consumption#get-connection-string-for-service-bus-namespace)
- (If the connection is established via the Password Less method) [Namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quickstart-topics-subscriptions-portal#create-a-namespace-in-the-azure-portal)

## Step 2: Add an integration for Azure Service Bus

After obtaining the credentials, add an Azure Service Bus integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an Azure Service Bus integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Message Broker** section, choose **Azure Service Bus**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Paremeters | Description | Required / Optional | 
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- | 
| Integration name | A name for the integration. | Required. | 
| Connection Type | The connection type to establish the connection. Supported values:<ul><li>**Connection String**</li><li>**Password Less**</li></ul> | Required. | 
| Endpoint | The endpoint of the service bus. | Required if **_Connection Type_** is **Connection String**. | 
| Namespace | The namespace of the service bus. | Required if **_Connection Type_** is **Connection String**. | 
| Description | A description of the integration. | Required. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which applications or groups can use the message broker.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required message broker and toggle the necessary permissions.

The group or application can now access the message broker according to the configured permissions.

## Next steps

With the integration in place, you can now:

- [Create Event Handlers](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/event-handler) for use in [Event tasks](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/event).
- [Enable Change Data Capture (CDC)](https://orkes.io/content/developer-guides/enabling-cdc-on-conductor-workflows) to send workflow state changes to message brokers.
