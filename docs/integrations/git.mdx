# Git Repository Integration with Orkes Conductor

:::info Available since
- v5.2.11 and later
:::

To use AI tasks like [List Files](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/list-files) and [Parse Document](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/parse-document) that need to access files or documents stored in Git repositories, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the required Git provider. This integration is necessary when accessing private repositories or any source that isn’t publicly available. This guide explains how to integrate a Git Repository with Orkes Conductor. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials.
2. Configure a new Git Repository integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Set access limits for the integration to govern which applications or groups can use it.

## Step 1: Get the credentials

To integrate a repository with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the username and API key (or personal access token) from your repository account.

Follow the official documentation for your Git provider:

- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
- [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/)
- [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/using-app-passwords/)

## Step 2: Add an integration for Git Repository

After obtaining the credentials, add a Git Repository integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Integrations** section, choose **Git Repository**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| User Name | The username associated with the API key in the repository. | 
| API Key | The API key linked to the username. | 
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which [applications](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications) or [groups](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/users-and-groups#groups) can use them.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required integration and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**.

The group or application can now access the integration according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using the [List Files](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/list-files) task or the [Parse Document](/content/reference-docs/ai-tasks/parse-document) task.
