# SendGrid Email Integration with Orkes Conductor

To use the [SendGrid task](/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/sendgrid) in Orkes Conductor, you must integrate your Conductor cluster with the SendGrid provider. This guide explains how to set up the integration. Here’s an overview:

1. Get the required credentials from SendGrid.
2. Configure a new SendGrid Email integration in Orkes Conductor.
3. Set access limits for the integration to govern which applications or groups can use it.

## Step 1: Get the SendGrid credentials

To integrate SendGrid with Orkes Conductor, retrieve the API key from the SendGrid console.

**To get the API key:**

1. Sign in to the [SendGrid console](https://app.sendgrid.com/).
2. Go to [**Settings** > **API Keys**](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) from the left menu.
3. Select **Create API Key**.
4. Enter an **API Key Name**, and select the required **API Key Permissions**.

5. Select **Create & View**.
6. Copy and store the generated key securely, as it is shown only once.

## Step 2: Add an integration for SendGrid Email

After obtaining the credentials, add a SendGrid Email integration to your Conductor cluster.

**To create an integration:**

1. Go to **Integrations** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Select **+ New integration**.
3. In the **Email** section, choose **SendGrid Email**.
4. Select **+ Add** and enter the following parameters:

| Parameters | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| API Key | The API key copied previously from the SendGrid console.
| Description | A description of the integration. |

5. (Optional) Toggle the **Active** button off if you don’t want to activate the integration instantly.
6. Select **Save**.

## Step 3: Set access limits to integration

Once the integration is configured, set access controls to manage which [applications](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications) or [groups](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/users-and-groups#groups) can use them.

**To provide access to an application or group:**

1. Go to **Access Control** > **Applications** or **Groups** from the left navigation menu on your Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group/application or select an existing one.
3. In the **Permissions** section, select **+ Add Permission**.
4. In the **Integration** tab, select the required integration and toggle the necessary permissions.
5. Select **Add Permissions**.

The group or application can now access the integration according to the configured permissions.

With the integration in place, you can now create workflows using the [SendGrid task](/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/sendgrid).
