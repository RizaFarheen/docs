# Integrating with Relational Database in Orkes Conductor

To effectively manage and optimize your workflows in Orkes Conductor, it's essential to integrate your Orkes Conductor cluster with a relational database management system (RDBMS). 

The choice of database depends on your specific use case, such as transaction processing, analytical querying, or data warehousing. It also depends on the functionalities you require, including indexing, partitioning, and replication, as well as the specific data management tasks you intend to perform, such as data integrity, concurrency control, and recovery. 

This guide will provide the steps for integrating relational database providers with Orkes Conductor.

## Steps to integrate with Relational Database 

Orkes Conductor supports integration with the Postgres database, and you need to have the following parameters ready: _database username_, _password_, and _URL_.

Now, letâ€™s integrate Postgres database with Orkes Conductor.

1. Navigate to **Integrations** from the left menu on your Orkes Conductor cluster.
2. Click **+New integration** button from the top-right.
3. Under the **RDBMS** section, choose **Relational Database**. 
4. Click **+Add** and provide the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Integration name | A name for the integration. |
| Database Type | Choose the type of database to integrate. Currently supports **_Postgres_**. |
| Database User | The database username. |
| Database Password | The password associated with the username. |
| Database URL | The database URL.<br/><br/>**Note**: To use this integration for [JDBC](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/jdbc) tasks, ensure that you provide the JDBC connection string in the format:  **_jdbc:database://url/databaseName_**. |
| Description | A description of your integration. |

5. You can toggle-on the **Active** button to activate the integration instantly.
6. Click **Save**.

## Adding Relational Database tables to integration

You have now integrated your Orkes Conductor cluster with the Postgres database. The next step is to integrate with the specific tables.

To add a new table to the database integration:

1. Navigate to the integrations page and click the '+' button next to the integration created.

2. Click **+New Table**.
3. Provide the table name and an optional description. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/create-new-relational-database-integration-table.png" alt="Create Relational Database Integration Table" width="60%" height="auto"></img></p>

4. Toggle-on the **Active** button to enable the table immediately.
5. Click **Save**.

## RBAC - Governance on who can use Integrations

The integration with the required database is now ready. Next, we should determine the access control to these databases. The permission can be granted to applications/groups within the Orkes Conductor cluster. 

To provide explicit permission to Groups:

1. Navigate to **Access Control > Groups** from the left menu on your Orkes Conductor cluster.
2. Create a new group or choose an existing group.
3. Under the **Permissions** section, click **+Add Permission**.
4. Under the **Integrations** tab, select the required integrations with the required permissions. 

<p align="center"><img src="/content/img/rbac-relational-database-integration.png" alt="Add Permissions for Integrations" width="60%" height="auto"></img></p>

5. Click **Add Permissions**. This ensures that all the group members can access these integrations in their workflows. 

Similarly, you can also provide permissions to [applications](https://orkes.io/content/access-control-and-security/applications#configuring-application). 


:::note
Once the integration is set up and the required access is granted, the integration can be utilized for [JDBC](https://orkes.io/content/reference-docs/system-tasks/jdbc) tasks within Orkes Conductor.
